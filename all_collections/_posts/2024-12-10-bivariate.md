It is often said that the second movie is not as good, but is that true? What are the average score threw the different movies in a franchise? 

[vote through the sequel 18]

At this stage of the data analysis, the stereotype holds: the average rating tends to drop for the second movie. However, as mentioned earlier, franchise films include several outliers. So, what could be the recipe to make the best possible sequel?

Adventure, Fantasy, Animation, Science Fiction, and Action are the top five most profitable genres. Interestingly, this does not align with the most frequently occurring genres.

To explore further in this analysis, we could compare whether a franchise originates from a well-known book or is linked to the sale of movie-related games, providing a clearer understanding of the potential nostalgia effect.

### How well are entire franchises succesful? 
On the other hand the franchise's average vote are correlated with the franchise's profit.[correlation vote average budget]

Several theories could explain this correlation. A franchise likely requires less marketing and communication budget compared to a single movie, as it is already familiar to the public. Additionally, some costs, such as set design or actor fees, might be reduced (actors may have contracts for multiple films).
