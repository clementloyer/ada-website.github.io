To keep in mind every values concerning profit, budget, revenue are inflation adjusted. 

As supected before there is a positvie linear regression between revenue and budget that is even greater in franchise movies. 

PLOT CORRELATION BUDGET _REVENUE
Now we might questioned what else could influence the success of franchise movies.  

*** Budget and genres
**What** are the most profitable genres? 

PLOT "ADJUSTED BOX OFFICE REVENUE BY GENRE" 

Adventure, Fantasy, Animation, Science Fiction, and Action are the top five most profitable genres. Interestingly, this does not align with the most frequently occurring genres. 

How about our favorite franchise? Does it follow the analysis? 
Acctually yes! 

*** Time dependancies 

NOT SURE FOR THIS PART 
One might wonder, does the time beetween two releases impact revenue or average vote. It could be logical that this period could increase nostalgia and therefore boost these two features. But no! 
PLOT :Box office of a movie and the average vote of a movie vs the year difference between the movies

*** Budget and vote
On the other hand the franchise's average vote are correlated with the budget.
