### How much are franchise movies appreciated by the public?
It is often said that the second movie is not as good, but is that true? What are the average score threw the different movies in a franchise?

At this stage of the data analysis, the stereotype holds: the average rating tends to drop for the second movie. However, as mentioned earlier, franchise films include several outliers. So, what could be the recipe to make the best possible sequel?

### How do budget and revenue behave?
To keep in mind every values concerning profit, budget, revenue are inflation adjusted. 

As supected before there is a positvie linear regression between revenue and budget that is even greater in franchise movies.

Now we might questioned what else could influence the success of franchise movies. 

Let's see if the budget and revenue increases or not throughout the franchise :

It decreases. The stereotype continues...

The ratio of the revenue over the budget decreases also. 



**What** are the most profitable **genres**?

PLOT "ADJUSTED BOX OFFICE REVENUE BY GENRE" 16

Adventure, Fantasy, Animation, Science Fiction, and Action are the top five most profitable genres. Interestingly, this does not align with the most frequently occurring genres. 

Are their some genres where the second movie is more profitable then the first movies ?

No, unless for documentary. One can say that the stereotype still increases. 


**Does** time between movie releases in the same franchise influence its success ? 

One might wonder whether the time between two releases affects revenue or average votes. It seems logical that this gap could trigger nostalgia and, in turn, enhance both factors. However, thatâ€™s not the case!

[PLOT :Box office of a movie and the average vote of a movie vs the year difference between the movies]
To explore further in this analysis, we could compare whether a franchise originates from a well-known book or is linked to the sale of movie-related games, providing a clearer understanding of the potential nostalgia effect.

### How well are entire franchises succesful? 
On the other hand the franchise's average vote are correlated with the franchise's profit.

Several theories could explain this correlation. A franchise likely requires less marketing and communication budget compared to a single movie, as it is already familiar to the public. Additionally, some costs, such as set design or actor fees, might be reduced (actors may have contracts for multiple films).
