### Univariate analysis : LOOK AT OUTLIERS AND SINGLE THEM OUT

And how do them compare to non-franchise movies ? Let’s take it step by step:

Where were the countries produced ?

plot 9

First, let’s look at a network graph to see where the countries were produced, and how they interact (edges and nodes) ⇒ we can’t really see anything …

plot 7

We see that the movies coming from the Us, Japan, Hong-Kong and Canada represent more of the total franchise movies than for non-franchise movies ! 

Now, what about the genres of our movies ?

plots 3 (?) and 4 ! and interpretation

Here, we can see that Dramas and Romances are a lot more present (three and two times more, respectively) in non-franchise movies than in franchise movies. Why is that ? Do the viewers lose interest when they are presented multiple dramas in a row ? If so, how would that translate ? In worse ratings ? Less box-office revenues ? 

The opposite is true for Action, Adventure, and Science-Fiction movies : they are around twice as present in franchise movies !

How were they appreciated by the public ?

How much money did they cost ?

plot 8

Does franchise movie have a largest budget ? Yes ! 

In general it is all most the double ! 

Too be as rigorous as possible all the values regarding expenses were match to the inflation rate at the release time of each movies. Now we can see the “real revenue” and “real budget” 

In general franchise movies has a larger budget then the other movies, but the difference is even more significant when looking at average revenue. 

Let’s finally, ask the question on everyone’s minds : how well do they perform ?

plot 9

Here the difference is even more flagrant ! In average a franchise movie makes 5 times more box office revenue then other movies ! 

Are you persuaded now that a movie in a franchise is more successful ? 

What is your favorite franchise ? Harry Potter, Star Wars or James Bond ? 

With this interactive graph now you can see which movies in its franchise had the best box office or the lowest, and even its budget. 

SUPER INTERACTIVE PLOT 

 A franchise movie is more successful but  how can this be explained ? **What** makes them more successful ? **Why** does franchise exists ? 

What if creating a second movie was a less risky investment then one single movie. In fact, if people liked the story plot of a movie it might be likely that they’ll go see the second movie ? In that case, what are the ratio between the revenue and the budget  ?
